# ModularRPG_Prototype

A modular, text-based RPG built in C++ with extensible systems for rooms, items, combat, and player stats. This prototype explores clean architecture, dynamic behaviors, and user-centered design principles.

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a fully functional RPG engine with modular components
- Prioritize extensibility for future content (e.g., new rooms, enemies, items)
- Apply systems thinking and empirical design to gameplay mechanics
- Ensure maintainable, readable code with clear class structures

## 🧩 Features

- **Room System**: Navigate interconnected spaces with unique descriptions and events
- **Item System**: Equip, use, and manage inventory with stat effects
- **Combat System**: Turn-based encounters with dynamic enemy behavior
- **Player Stats**: Health, strength, agility, and other attributes that evolve over time
- **Modular Design**: Easily add new content without rewriting core logic

## 🛠️ Technologies

- C++ (modular class-based architecture)
- Git for version control
- Designed for future integration with UI/UX layers

## 📚 Design Philosophy

This project blends technical precision with user empathy, drawing from:
- Empirical research on game engagement and accessibility
- Agile development practices and persona-driven design
- Ethical and inclusive design principles

## 🚧 Status

Early prototype. Core systems under active development.
